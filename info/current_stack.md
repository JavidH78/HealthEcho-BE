### Front-end Technologies:
1. **Redux**: For state management, especially if your application will have complex state interactions.
2. **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to your back-end API.
3. **Chart.js or D3.js**: For creating interactive and customizable data visualizations.
4. **Material-UI or Ant Design**: For pre-built UI components that can help speed up development and ensure a consistent design.
5. **React Router**: For handling navigation within your application.

### Back-end Technologies:
1. **Spring Data JPA**: For easier database interactions and to simplify data access layers.
2. **Spring Boot Actuator**: For monitoring and managing your application in production.
3. **Spring Cloud**: If you plan to scale your application or use microservices in the future.
4. **Hibernate**: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to manage database interactions more easily.
5. **RESTful API**: Ensure your back-end exposes a RESTful API for the front-end to interact with.
